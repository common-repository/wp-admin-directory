Group your admin dashboard menu items into a single directory page.

== Description ==

Has your admin dashboard is becoming a bit unwieldy with all the custom post types and plugin menu items?

Then WP Admin Directory might be just what you need.

WP Admin Directory will take the admin dashboard menu items you select and place them into a page under the Directory menu item. 

WP Admin Directory is a must have for any WordPress sites that have a menu so long that you have to search to find the item you want. Menus should make it easy to find what you're looking for. If you're having trouble finding what your after, then WP Admin Directory might be just what you need.

Accessing the Admin Directory from the frontend is also a cinch with the 'Directory' link that's added to the WordPress Admin Bar. Just click the link and be taken straight to the directory page.
